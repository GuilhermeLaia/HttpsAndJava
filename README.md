# HttpsAndJava
Together with my teammate we tried to implemented the HTTPS client in Java. Combining our knowledge about the TLS/SSL handshake and the experience from the manual test with curl we assumed that only three files were required to implement the client side: a client's certificate, a client's private key and a trusted certificate to verify the server's certificate.
